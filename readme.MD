### Philosophy

We believe in open data. Our scripts may be too technical for the average reader, but we make it accessible because we believe it is important to be as transparent as possible about our methodology so our work can be checked or expanded upon. [Read more](http://www.trendct.org/data).

Check out the reproducible scripts and data behind many of our other stories in our [central repo](https://github.com/trendct-data)

Follow us out on Twitter [@TrendCT](http://www.trendct.org) and on [Facebook/TrendCT](https://www.facebook.com/trendct/).

### Usage

If you use our data or methodology, please give us a shout out in your story. It'd also be nice if you gave me a heads up: [@abtran](http://www.twitter.com/abtran) or abtran@trendct.org.
